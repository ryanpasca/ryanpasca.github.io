        		<h1>Ryan Pasca</h1>
			<p>
			Ryan grew up on the east coast and has spent most of his life in Durham, North Carolina. He went to college 
				at UNC Chapel Hill and graduated with a bachelors in chemistry. In college, Ryan got to study and 
				assist with one of UNC Pharmacy School's cancer research labs and helped contribute to a project 
				studying prostate cancer cells.
				Suprprisingly, organic chemistry was one of his favorite subjects. After unsuccessful attempts at getting 
				into medical school, (and because he needed a job) Ryan spent the summer after college doing contract 
				work in New Orleans, Louisiana. It was great to put his chemistry degree to good use and be in Louisiana, 
				but the stint in NOLA eventually lead Ryan to begin thinking about a career in the software industry.
				A couple months later Ryan moved to Austin, Texas where he now works full time for the second largest
				software company in the world. Since joining Oracle, Ryan has consulted b2b customers and helped optimize
				their utilization of enterprise software applications that manage core business processes, including ERP
				and HCM.
			<br>
			<br>
			Ryan's educational interests include fields at the interface of health, nutrition, technology, and preventative
				medicine to promote longevity and overall quality of life. He is also currently working to improve his
				skills in public speaking, sales, writing, and computer programming.
			<br>
				
			Outside of work, exercise and athletics have been a large part of Ryan's life. He grew up competing on 
				a travel soccer team and went on to join the varsity soccer and wrestling teams 
				in high school. Recently, he started running the hill country in Texas and is currently training for 
				his first marathon. 
				Beyond that, he is a proud Tarheel and enjoys following UNC basketball.
				Ryan loves meeting new people. Shoot a text/email to:
