			<h1>Ryan Pasca</h1>
			<p>
			I up on the east coast and have so far spent most of my life in Durham, North Carolina. During college at
				UNC Chapel Hill, where I studied chemistry I worked in the UNC Pharmacy School's cancer 
				research lab and contributed to a project aimed at preventing cancer cells from 
				growing and spreading.
			<br>
			<br>
			After unsuccessful plans for medical school, I spent 
				the summer after graduation doing contract work in southern Louisiana. It was great to put my 
				chemistry degree to use and party in New Orleans, but the stint in NOLA eventually lead me to begin 
				considering where I could take myself from there.
			<br>
			<br>
			A couple months later I moved to Austin, Texas where I worked full time for the second largest
				software company in the world. Since joining Oracle, I have worked with various clients helping optimize
				their utilization of enterprise software applications that manage core business processes, including ERP
				and HCM. I was soon promoted at Oracle and migrated to the San Francisco Bay Area. I currently work at 
				Oracle as an Account Executive covering cloud applications.
			<br>
			<br>
			My educational interests include fields at the interface of business, technology, healthcare. 
				I am currently working to improve my technical & business skills.
			<br>
			<br>
			Outside of work, exercise and athletics have been a large part of my life. I grew up competing on 
				a travel soccer team and went on to join the varsity soccer and wrestling teams 
				in high school. Since moving to northern California, I have spent many evenings and weekends in the 
				ocean learning to surf. You can find me at Linda Mar, or maybe down at Pleasure Point in Santa Cruz. 
				Over the coming months, I'd like to resume marathon training.
				Beyond that, I am a proud Tarheel and enjoy following UNC basketball.
				Always great to meet new people. If you'd like to connect, shoot a email/text to:
