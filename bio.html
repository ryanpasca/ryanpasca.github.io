        		<h1>Ryan Pasca</h1>
			<p>
			Ryan grew up on the east coast and has spent most of his life in Durham, North Carolina. He went to college 
				at UNC Chapel Hill and graduated with a bachelors in chemistry. Because organic chemistry was
				one of his best subjects in college, Ryan worked in the UNC Pharmacy School's cancer 
				research lab and contributed to a project aimed at preventing cancer cells from 
				growing and spreading.
			<br>
			<br>
			After unsuccessful attempts at getting into medical school, (and because he was running out of money) Ryan spent 
				the summer after college doing contract work in southern Louisiana. It was great to put his 
				chemistry degree to good use and party in New Orleans,, but the stint in NOLA eventually lead Ryan to begin 
				thinking about where he envisioned his career progressing.
			<br>
			<br>
			A couple months later Ryan moved to Austin, Texas where he worked full time for the second largest
				software company in the world. Since joining Oracle, Ryan has consulted b2b customers and helped optimize
				their utilization of enterprise software applications that manage core business processes, including ERP
				and HCM. Ryan was soon promoted at Oracle and migrated to the San Francisco Bay Area. He currently works
				as an Account Executive covering cloud applications.
			<br>
			<br>
			Ryan's educational interests include fields at the interface of health, nutrition, technology, and preventative
				medicine to promote longevity and overall quality of life. He is also currently working to improve his
				technical skills and overall business acumen.
			<br>
			<br>
			Outside of work, exercise and athletics have been a large part of Ryan's life. He grew up competing on 
				a travel soccer team and went on to join the varsity soccer and wrestling teams 
				in high school. Since moving to northern California, Ryan has spent many evenings and weekends in the 
				Ocean learning to surf. You can find him at Linda Mar, or maybe down at Pleasure Point in Santa Cruz. 
				Over the coming months, Ryan is training to run a marathon.
				Beyond that, he is a proud Tarheel and enjoys following UNC basketball.
				Ryan loves meeting new people. Shoot a text/email to:
